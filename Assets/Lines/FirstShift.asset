  - Well, look who it is! You must be our newest Travel Manager.
  - My name is Dean Fernal, I'm the Managing Director here at 9 Circles Of Home.
  - We're the first firm to help demons travel from Earth back to Hell...
  - ...and with so many poor devils stuck here after the invasion, we always have
    plenty of customers.
  - Anyway! I'll be showing you around during your first few days here.
  - Your job is picking the right Circle of Hell for each customer.
  - For your first shift, we're sending you our least picky clientele, so it will
    be as easy as matching colors.
  - Red customers need to be sent to Hot circles, Blue to Cold, and Purple like it
    anywhere.
  - '*Drag and drop a Customer over a Circle to send them to it.*'
  - The meter under the Customer shows your total success rate.
  - If you send someone where they don't want to go, it will drop.
  - Keep the meter above 50%, and you'll have nothing to worry about!
  - Right, enough chat. Get to it!
