  - 'Well, look who it is! Our newest travel manager. '
  - Allow me to formally welcome you to Nine Circles of Home, the first demonic tourism
    agency.
  - Folks are really excited to go back home after being stranded here on Earth for
    so long.
  - Problem is, no one really remembers which circle they're from.
  - So your job is to talk to them and find whatever clues you can to pick the right
    destination...
  - 'Sounds stressful? You bet! '
  - You've got this, though. Or, you know, you're fired.
