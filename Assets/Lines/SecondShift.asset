  - Now that you've got used to the office, we'll send you more... particular clients.
  - You might have noticed each circle has a name of its Environment on it.
  - 'A lot of demons have a preference for a particular Environment, and will need
    to be sent there. '
  - Others might be the opposite, and know exactly where they DON'T want to go.
  - Careful not to send them to their least favorite circle!
  - '*To get hints about where to send a Customer, hold the (?) button in the upper-left
    corner.*'
  - Alright, that about covers it. Good luck!
